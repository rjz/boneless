# Boneless.js

---

**WIP**: cut-and-paste Backbone, courtesy of `sed`. Legitimizing changes to
follow; but for now... just use Backbone.

---

Boneless distills [Backbone.js](http://github.com/jashkenas/backbone) to its
`Event`, `Model`, and `Collection` modules. It is intended:

  * to maintain Backbone's RESTful conventions
  * to provide a data layer for third-party UI libraries
  * to be as supportive as possible of both node and browser environments

And it owes everything to [Backbone.js](http://github.com/jashkenas/backbone),
[DocumentCloud](), [Jeremy Ashkenas](http://github.com/jashkenas), and all of
its other [contributors](http://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/contributors)

### API Compatibility

Boneless maintains API compatibility with *all* of Backbone's `Event`, `Model`,
and `Collection` modules. It will soon ship ~~with high-quality implementations
of `Backbone.sync` for use in both browser- and server-side environments.~~
